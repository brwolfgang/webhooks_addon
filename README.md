# Webhooks Addon
A Firefox webextension that adds webhooks to the context menu.

Simply put: 
1. Set your IFTTT key.
2. Add a command by using the trigger event and the context types the command should appear.
3. Right-click the content you'd like to perform the webhook action uppon.
4. Select the command you want to execute from the context menu.
5. The command is sent via web request and a nice notification shows up.

And it's done!
